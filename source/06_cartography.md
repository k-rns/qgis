The fornari qgis project has several layout templates of which you can choose one

[Give a list of all the layout templates in there]

Each template contains the following items:

* Map 
* Scalebar
* Legend
* North arrow

Interacting with the layout and adding items to the map is done by using the item bar on the left. When adding items to the map, they will appear in the "Items" list on the right. Each item has specific properties that can be adjusted in the Item properties box, under "Items". Make sure that the item you want to adjust is clicked on (=blue), before you can adjust that specific item.

2. Select in the Item Properties of the map -> Grids
